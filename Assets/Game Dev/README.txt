== Game Dev Package ==
By Jack Davenport

This package contains the basic assets and scripts used throughout the workshop. Students should import it at the beginning
of the first session, commit it to their repositories, and it will be used during each session. There are different instructions
for this folder after it's been imported for students and instructors.

FOR STUDENTS:
Unless you've used Unity before, probably do not edit/delete anything in this folder. If you do, you might find that your game will
break or otherwise not work how you're expecting it to. This may result in you needing to reimport the package or reverse to a previous
backup. So it's best to leave this folder as-is unless you know what you're doing.

FOR INSTRUCTORS:
Make sure that students import the package at the beginning of the FIRST session. It is required for all sessions during the workshop.
There is a file provided in the base of this repository (called FutureTechGameDev.unitypackage). Rather than sharing this folder with
the students, you should give them that file instead, and follow the instructions below to import it into Unity once they have made their
own project.

ADDING THE UNITY PACKAGE:
	1) Make sure the FutureTechGameDev.unitypackage file is on each student's device and is easily accessible.
	2) Make sure they have first created both a Unity project and a GitHub repository (refer to curriculum documentation)
	3) In Unity, go to Assets > Import package > Custom package...
	4) In the file selector, select the FutureTechGameDev.unitypackage file and click 'OK'
	5) A popup will appear with a list of files in the package. Make sure they are all ticked, and click 'Import'
	6) Wait for the assets to be imported into the project
	7) A new folder should appear in the Assets folder called 'Game Dev'. You're ready to go!
